# week1.day3.spaceInvadersPlanning

## Instructions
1. Use this time to plan out how your group will build the MVP for a Space Invaders game.
    - Remember: you DON’T need to build out a completely functional game.
2. You will be creating a game that functions similar to the [classic Space Invaders’ game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1jZaIPeD5w).
3. First, wireframe with your game with your group
    - Consider what the user will see and interact with? Where should the ship be? Where should the enemies be?
    - Once done, present your wireframe to your instructional team for approval.
      - If your wireframe is not approved, make any necessary revisions and try again.
4. Once approved, plan out the tasks to be completed
    - Break down large tasks into smaller ones and assign these task accordingly
    - Here’s a rough outline to get your outline started (feel free to alter or expand on this!)
      - Make 1 ship
        - Make ship move with LEFT_ARROW, RIGHT_ARROW
      - Make 1 bullet that moves from bottom to the top
        - Create that bullet (circle) when spacebar pressed
        - Create that bullet at the proper location from the ship, wherever it is
      - Create 1 enemy (circle)
        - Have that enemy disappear when bullet hits it (see collision detection example)
        - Have the bullet disappear on hit, too
      - Create more enemies…
    - Be sure to assign who in your group is responsible for what
5. Once done, [move onto the next phase!](https://github.com/AllStarCodeOrg/week1.day3.pokemonBattle)
